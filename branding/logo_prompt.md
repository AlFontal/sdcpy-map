# GPT-5.2 Logo Prompt for sdcpy-map

Design a clean, modern logo for `sdcpy-map`, a scientific Python extension for spatial scale-dependent correlation maps.

Concept:
- Combine the idea of "correlation" and "maps" in a single mark.
- Include a subtle grid or latitude/longitude mesh.
- Include two wave-like curves crossing to suggest correlation dynamics.
- Include a single highlighted node or cell to suggest local signal extraction.

Style:
- Minimal, geometric, technical, publication-ready.
- Flat vector style, no 3D effects.
- Works in monochrome and color.
- High legibility at small sizes (favicon/app icon).

Color direction:
- Primary palette inspired by scientific diverging maps:
  - deep blue `#2166AC`
  - off-white `#F7F7F7`
  - warm red `#B2182B`
- Optional accent: muted teal `#1B9E77`.

Typography:
- Use a monospaced or semi-monospace modern typeface for wordmark.
- Keep `sdcpy-map` in lowercase.

Deliverables:
1. Symbol-only version.
2. Horizontal lockup with wordmark.
3. Light and dark background variants.
4. SVG-first output.
